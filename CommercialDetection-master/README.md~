# CommercialDetection
GSOC 2015 project for Red Hen Labs. More details here http://vasanthkalingeri.github.io/CommercialDetection/

##Instructions to run

*Run dependencies.sh script

*Create a database in Mysql to store fingerprints

*Open src/constants.py, edit the line
    
    CONFIG = {
      "database": {
          "host": "127.0.0.1",
          "user": <username>,
          "passwd": <password>,
          "db": <name of the database created>
      }
    }
  
###To teach new commercials

*Create a file like data/labels for the given video

    python src/main.py -g data/video.mpg data/labels

*The above creates a directory called db containing the commercials labelled. The system also learns from these commercials

###To detect commercials

    python src/main.py -r data/test.mpg

*This will create a file called output.txt containing the detected commercials.

*It will have unclassified sections which can later be seen and edited. The edited file can be used as labels file for learning new commercials.

*Edit content in output.txt after watching the video manually.

*Now using output.txt as labels for test.mpg, run the program again to update the db with new commercials.

    python src/main.py -g data/test.mpg output.txt
